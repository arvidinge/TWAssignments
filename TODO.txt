bugs:
* full sync needs to broadcast which template to use
  - the frame did not expand to contain all the cells if template was changed while window is closed
* moving to empty group causes state to go from raid to alone
  - should just treat the events as one always (if party and raid event within 0.2 seconds). 
* verkar inte byta template förrän load knapp?
* doesnt recognize leader does not have twa
  - pick syncmaster from dropdown?
* assistant left the raid säger cozzalisa om och om igen

features:
* roster account/character profiles?

leader and assistants all share roster while in raid
  - what to do on duplicate name but different class? just add both entries in first version
  - remove foreign roster entries when assistants leave group (implemented but not tested)
    * to test this, kick an assistant that has some roster entries. they should go away.
  - remove all foreign roster entries when you leave group (implemented but not tested)
    * to test this, leave a raid group where other people have shared rosters with you. Then join another raid group. The original raid group's roster entries should be gone.

implement a cooldown/debounce for full syncs for like 5 seconds (to reduce traffic while doing a lot of invites)
  - you can pass a callback to SendAddonMessage to know when a sync completes. If more requests came in during last sync, sync again
