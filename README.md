## Installation

### GitAddonsManager (recommended)
The best way to keep the addon up to date would be [GitAddonsManager](https://woblight.gitlab.io/overview/gitaddonsmanager/).
[Here are some usage instructions](https://turtle-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Addons#How_to_Install_Addons).
Add `https://github.com/arvidinge/TWAssignments.git` to GitAddonsManager and make sure the `master` branch is selected. Using GitAddonsManager you can check for and install updates for all your AddOns with 1 click.

### Manual
1. On the [main page](https://github.com/arvidinge/TWAssignments/tree/master) of the repo, click the code dropdown ![Code dropdown](images/codeButton.png) and download the repo as a .zip.
1. Unpack the .zip and rename the folder to `TWAssignments` (remove the `-master` part).
1. Move the folder into your Interface/AddOns directory and restart the game.
You will have to do this every time there is a new update, and you won't know there's an update before you visist this page again. I recommend using an addon manager like [GitAddonsManager](#gitaddonsmanager) instead.
